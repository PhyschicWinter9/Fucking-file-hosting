# Error Pages Documentation

This document describes the custom error pages implemented for the Fucking File Hosting application.

## Overview

Custom error pages have been created to maintain the application's theme and provide a better user experience when errors occur. All error pages follow the same design language as the main application with the signature orange/red gradient theme.

## Error Pages Created

- **When shown**: When a user tries to access a non-existent page
- **Features**:
  - File ID search functionality
  - Quick upload access
  - Navigation back to home
  - Maintains brand consistency

### 2. 403 - Access Forbidden (`/resources/js/pages/Errors/403.tsx`)
- **When shown**: When a user tries to access a restricted resource
- **Features**:
  - Explanation of access restrictions
  - File ID checker
  - Alternative actions (upload, home)
  - Information about what's accessible without permissions

### 3. 500 - Server Error (`/resources/js/pages/Errors/500.tsx`)
- **When shown**: When an internal server error occurs
- **Features**:
  - Refresh page functionality
  - Explanation of possible causes
  - Alternative actions
  - Reassurance about file safety

### 4. 503 - Service Unavailable (`/resources/js/pages/Errors/503.tsx`)

- **Features**:
  - Maintenance explanation
  - Auto-refresh capability
  - Information about what's being improved
  - Status indicators

### 5. File Not Found (`/resources/js/pages/Errors/FileNotFound.tsx`)
- **When shown**: When a specific file ID doesn't exist or has expired
- **Features**:
  - Shows the specific file ID that wasn't found
  - Explains possible reasons (expired, invalid, etc.)
  - Quick file ID search
  - Upload replacement functionality

## Implementation Details

### Laravel Views
Each error page has a corresponding Laravel Blade view in `/resources/views/errors/`:
- `404.blade.php`
- `403.blade.php`
- `500.blade.php`
- `503.blade.php`

These views render the React components using Inertia.js.

### Exception Handler
A custom exception handler (`/app/Exceptions/Handler.php`) has been created to:
- Detect file-related 404 errors and show the FileNotFound component
- Route different HTTP status codes to appropriate error pages
- Maintain the application's Inertia.js structure

### Error Controller
An `ErrorController` (`/app/Http/Controllers/ErrorController.php`) provides methods for:
- Rendering specific error pages
- Handling file not found scenarios with file ID context
- Testing error pages in development

## Testing Error Pages

In development/testing environments, you can test error pages using these routes:
- `/test/404` - Test 404 page
- `/test/403` - Test 403 page
- `/test/500` - Test 500 page
- `/test/503` - Test 503 page
- `/test/file-not-found/{fileId?}` - Test file not found page

**Note**: These test routes are only available in local and testing environments.

## Design Features

All error pages include:

### Visual Elements
- **Gradient Icons**: Orange/red gradient circular icons with relevant symbols
- **Animated Elements**: Hover effects, pulse animations, and smooth transitions
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with proper scaling
- **Brand Consistency**: Uses the same color scheme and typography as the main app

### Interactive Elements
- **Action Cards**: Clickable cards with hover effects for different actions
- **File ID Search**: Inline search functionality for checking specific files
- **Quick Navigation**: Easy access to upload and home pages
- **Refresh Functionality**: JavaScript-powered page refresh for applicable errors

### Content Strategy
- **Brand Voice**: Maintains the edgy, direct tone with strategic use of "fucking"
- **Helpful Information**: Explains what went wrong and why
- **Clear Actions**: Provides obvious next steps for users
- **Reassurance**: Emphasizes privacy, security, and reliability

## Customization

### Adding New Error Pages
1. Create a new React component in `/resources/js/pages/Errors/`
2. Create a corresponding Blade view in `/resources/views/errors/`
3. Update the `Handler.php` to route the error code
4. Add test routes in `web.php` if needed

### Modifying Existing Pages
- Update the React components for UI changes
- Modify the exception handler for routing logic changes
- Update this documentation for any significant changes

## SEO and Meta Tags

All error pages include:
- Proper page titles with error codes
- Meta descriptions explaining the error
- Open Graph images for social sharing
- Canonical URLs and proper HTTP status codes

## Accessibility

Error pages follow accessibility best practices:
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Alt text for icons and images
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly content
- High contrast color schemes

## Performance

- **Lazy Loading**: Error pages are only loaded when needed
- **Optimized Assets**: Uses the same CSS/JS bundle as the main app
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Reuses existing components and utilities
- **Fast Rendering**: Server-side rendering with Inertia.js

## Browser Compatibility

Error pages work across all modern browsers and include:
- Progressive enhancement
- Fallback styles for older browsers
- Mobile-responsive design
- Touch-friendly interactions

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Test error pages after major updates
- Update content if service features change
- Monitor error page analytics (if implemented)
- Review and update test routes

### Monitoring
- Check that custom error pages are being served correctly
- Monitor for any JavaScript errors on error pages
- Ensure proper HTTP status codes are returned
- Verify mobile responsiveness

## Security Considerations

- Error pages don't expose sensitive information
- File IDs are validated before display
- No user data is logged on error pages
- Proper CSRF protection maintained
- Privacy-compliant error handling
