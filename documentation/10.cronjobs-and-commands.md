# 10. Cronjobs and Custom Commands

## Overview

The Fucking File Hosting application includes a comprehensive set of custom Artisan commands and automated cronjobs for maintenance, monitoring, and optimization. This system ensures optimal performance and automatic cleanup of expired files and temporary data.

## 🕐 Automated Cronjobs (Laravel Scheduler)

### Setting Up the Master Cron Job

Add this **single cron job** to your server to enable all automated tasks:

```bash
* * * * * cd /path/to/your/project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

## 📊 Monitoring and Performance

### Resource Monitoring

The monitoring system tracks:

- **Server Load**: CPU usage and system load
- **Memory Usage**: Current, peak, and percentage usage
- **Disk Usage**: Storage consumption and available space
- **Active Sessions**: Current upload sessions
- **File Statistics**: Total files, sizes, and growth rates

### Performance Optimization

The optimization system provides:

- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes expired and temporary files
- **Database Optimization**: Optimizes tables and clears caches
- **Memory Management**: Garbage collection and cache clearing
- **Load Balancing**: Adjusts settings based on current load

### Hosting-Specific Recommendations

The system provides tailored recommendations for your hosting environment:

- **Chunk Size**: Optimal chunk size based on memory limits
- **Concurrent Uploads**: Maximum safe concurrent uploads
- **Cleanup Frequency**: How often to run cleanup based on usage
- **File Retention**: Optimal retention periods based on storage limits

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Configure cronjob behavior with these environment variables:

```env
# Cleanup Configuration
CLEANUP_TEMP_CHUNKS_ENABLED=true
CLEANUP_TEMP_CHUNKS_AGE_HOURS=24
CLEANUP_FAILED_UPLOADS_ENABLED=true
CLEANUP_FAILED_UPLOADS_AGE_HOURS=72
CLEANUP_ORPHANED_FILES_ENABLED=true
CLEANUP_EMPTY_DIRECTORIES_ENABLED=true

# Performance Monitoring
PERFORMANCE_MONITORING_ENABLED=true
RESOURCE_MONITORING_ENABLED=true
OPTIMIZATION_ENABLED=true

# Maintenance Mode
MAINTENANCE_MODE_ENABLED=false
MAINTENANCE_MESSAGE="We're making improvements. Be back soon!"
```

### Customizing Schedules

Edit `app/Console/Kernel.php` to customize the schedule:

```php
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule): void
{
    // Custom schedule example
    $schedule->command('files:cleanup --force')
             ->dailyAt('01:00') // Run at 1 AM instead of 2 AM
             ->withoutOverlapping()
             ->runInBackground();
    
    // Add custom frequency
    $schedule->command('filehosting:monitor')
             ->everyFifteenMinutes() // More frequent monitoring
             ->withoutOverlapping();
}
```

## 🚨 Emergency Commands

### Quick System Recovery

```bash
# Emergency cleanup (frees maximum space)
php artisan upload:cleanup-all --force
php artisan filehosting:optimize --aggressive

# System health check
php artisan filehosting:monitor

# Reset maintenance mode if stuck
php artisan maintenance disable
```

### Troubleshooting Commands

```bash
# Check system status
php artisan about

# Clear all caches
php artisan optimize:clear

# Check scheduled tasks
php artisan schedule:list

# Test scheduler
php artisan schedule:test
```

## 📈 Best Practices

### Cronjob Management

1. **Monitor Logs**: Regularly check cronjob execution logs
2. **Test Schedules**: Use `--dry-run` options to test commands
3. **Backup Before Cleanup**: Always backup before aggressive cleanup
4. **Monitor Resources**: Watch system resources during cleanup

### Performance Optimization

1. **Run During Low Traffic**: Schedule heavy operations during off-peak hours
2. **Use Background Processing**: Enable `runInBackground()` for long-running tasks
3. **Prevent Overlapping**: Use `withoutOverlapping()` to prevent conflicts
4. **Monitor Results**: Check optimization reports regularly

### Maintenance Planning

1. **Schedule Maintenance**: Plan maintenance windows in advance
2. **Notify Users**: Use custom maintenance messages
3. **Test Recovery**: Regularly test backup and recovery procedures
4. **Document Changes**: Keep track of configuration changes

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Cronjobs Not Running**
```bash
# Check if cron service is running
systemctl status cron

# Verify crontab entry
crontab -l

# Test scheduler manually
php artisan schedule:run
```

**High Resource Usage**
```bash
# Check current load
php artisan filehosting:monitor

# Run optimization
php artisan filehosting:optimize --aggressive

# Check for stuck processes
ps aux | grep php
```

**Cleanup Failures**
```bash
# Check file permissions
ls -la storage/

# Run with verbose output
php artisan files:cleanup -v

# Check disk space
df -h
```

### Log Files

Monitor these log files for cronjob issues:

- `storage/logs/laravel.log` - Application logs
- `/var/log/cron` - System cron logs
- `storage/logs/scheduler.log` - Laravel scheduler logs
