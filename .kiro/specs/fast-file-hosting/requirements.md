# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a fast, privacy-oriented file hosting website. The system will allow users to upload files up to 100MB (Cloudflare free plan limit) quickly without registration, share them via cryptographically secure direct links, and download them without speed limitations. The focus is on blazing speed, complete privacy, and radical simplicity with a dark theme and orange/red gradient accents. The system supports download managers like IDM and provides immediate download links after upload.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload files anonymously with drag-and-drop support, so that I can share files immediately without any registration or personal information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the homepage THEN the system SHALL display a large drag-and-drop upload area as the primary interface

4. WHEN a file upload completes THEN the system SHALL provide a cryptographically secure, unguessable download URL
5. WHEN uploading THEN the system SHALL show real-time upload progress with animated progress bars
6. WHEN files exceed 100MB limit THEN the system SHALL display clear error messaging before upload begins
7. WHEN handling large files over 25MB THEN the system SHALL use chunked upload for optimal performance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to download files at maximum speed with no throttling, so that I can access shared content as fast as my connection allows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks a download link THEN the system SHALL serve the file without any speed caps or artificial limits
2. WHEN serving files THEN the system SHALL use memory-efficient streaming for large files
3. WHEN multiple users download simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain performance for all users
4. WHEN serving media files THEN the system SHALL support direct viewing/playing with proper MIME type detection
5. IF a file doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL return a user-friendly 404 error page
6. WHEN downloading THEN the system SHALL provide proper file headers for browser compatibility

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want complete anonymity with zero tracking, so that my uploads and downloads cannot be monitored or logged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users upload files THEN the system SHALL NOT log IP addresses, user agents, or any personal identifiers
2. WHEN users download files THEN the system SHALL NOT create access logs with personal data
3. WHEN storing files THEN the system SHALL NOT associate files with user identities or sessions
4. WHEN generating download links THEN the system SHALL use cryptographic hashes for unguessable URLs
5. WHEN serving pages THEN the system SHALL NOT include cookies, tracking pixels, or analytics scripts
6. WHEN handling requests THEN the system SHALL NOT integrate with external tracking services

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want a blazingly fast, minimal dark-themed interface, so that I can upload and share files without bloatware or slow loading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the homepage loads THEN the system SHALL load in under 1 second on modern connections
2. WHEN displaying the interface THEN the system SHALL use a dark theme with orange/red gradient accents (#ff6b35, #f7931e)

7. WHEN showing features THEN the system SHALL include a showcase section highlighting speed, privacy, and simplicity

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want flexible file management with optional expiration, so that I can control how long my files remain available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users upload files THEN the system SHALL support all file types with proper MIME detection
2. WHEN uploading THEN the system SHALL allow optional expiration settings (1-365 days or permanent)
3. WHEN files expire THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up expired files via cron jobs
4. WHEN displaying file info THEN the system SHALL show size, type, upload date, and expiration
5. WHEN detecting duplicates THEN the system SHALL implement deduplication to save storage space
6. WHEN verifying uploads THEN the system SHALL use checksums for file integrity verification
7. WHEN uploading multiple files THEN the system SHALL support bulk upload functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a RESTful API for programmatic access, so that I can integrate file uploads into other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN uploading via API THEN the system SHALL support curl uploads and integrations
3. WHEN responding to API calls THEN the system SHALL return JSON responses for AJAX requests
4. WHEN handling API abuse THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting while maintaining speed
5. WHEN using the API THEN the system SHALL require no authentication for ease of use
6. WHEN providing API responses THEN the system SHALL include proper HTTP status codes and error messages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system built with Laravel 12 and optimized for shared hosting, so that I can deploy and maintain a production-ready application on cPanel hosting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL use Laravel 12 with PHP 8.2+ features compatible with shared hosting
2. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use MySQL database compatible with shared hosting environments
3. WHEN handling file operations THEN the system SHALL use Laravel's filesystem abstraction with shared hosting optimizations
4. WHEN managing routes THEN the system SHALL use clean, RESTful API design
5. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL support cPanel-compatible file structure with public_html deployment
6. WHEN configuring THEN the system SHALL use .env files for environment-based configuration
7. WHEN securing THEN the system SHALL implement proper security headers and CSRF protection

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want shared hosting compatibility with cPanel support, so that the application works within typical hosting provider limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL use cPanel-friendly deployment structure with traditional FTP/SFTP upload
2. WHEN configuring web server THEN the system SHALL use .htaccess rules for URL rewriting and security
3. WHEN managing uploads THEN the system SHALL configure file upload limits via .htaccess and PHP settings
