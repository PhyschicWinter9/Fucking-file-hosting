# 2MB Chunk Configuration Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented 2MB chunk configuration optimized for shared hosting environments with comprehensive cleanup functionality and environment-based settings.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

### 1. 2MB Chunk Size Configuration
- **Default chunk size**: 2MB (2,097,152 bytes)
- **Optimized for shared hosting**: Uses less memory, saves inodes, Cloudflare compatible
- **Environment configurable**: `CHUNK_SIZE=2097152` in `.env`
- **Future upgrade ready**: Comments included for easy hardware upgrades

### 2. Environment-Based Configuration
Updated `.env.example` with:
```env
# 2MB chunks recommended for shared hosting
CHUNK_SIZE=2097152
CHUNKED_UPLOAD_SESSION_TIMEOUT_HOURS=48
CHUNKED_UPLOAD_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_HOURS=6
CHUNKED_UPLOAD_MAX_RETRIES=3

# Future hardware upgrade note:
# CHUNK_SIZE_FUTURE_UPGRADE=10485760  # 10MB for better hardware

# Cleanup Configuration
CLEANUP_TEMP_CHUNKS_ENABLED=true
CLEANUP_FAILED_UPLOADS_ENABLED=true
CLEANUP_TEMP_CHUNKS_AGE_HOURS=24
CLEANUP_FAILED_UPLOADS_AGE_HOURS=72
CLEANUP_ORPHANED_FILES_ENABLED=true
CLEANUP_EMPTY_DIRECTORIES_ENABLED=true
```

### 3. Enhanced Cleanup System

#### New Cleanup Commands
1. **`upload:cleanup-temp`** - Comprehensive temporary file cleanup
   - Cleans expired temp chunks
   - Removes failed upload sessions
   - Deletes orphaned files (files without database records)
   - Removes empty directories
   - Supports `--dry-run` and `--force` options

2. **`upload:cleanup-all`** - Runs all cleanup operations
   - Expired files cleanup
   - Expired sessions cleanup  
   - Temporary files cleanup
   - Comprehensive reporting

3. **`upload:chunk-config`** - Display current configuration
   - Shows chunk size and settings
   - Environment analysis
   - Recommendations based on current setup
   - Future upgrade guidance

#### Automatic Scheduling
Added to Laravel scheduler (`app/Console/Kernel.php`):
- **Expired files**: Daily at 2 AM
- **Temporary files**: Twice daily (2 AM, 2 PM)
- **Upload sessions**: Every 6 hours (existing)
- **Comprehensive cleanup**: Weekly on Sunday at 3 AM

### 4. Configuration Updates

#### `config/filehosting.php`
- Updated chunk size default to 2MB with detailed comments
- Added comprehensive cleanup configuration section
- Included future upgrade guidance in comments

#### `app/Services/ChunkedUploadService.php`
- Updated default chunk size to use config value (2MB)
- Modified `initializeSession()` to use configured chunk size
- Updated `calculateOptimalChunkSize()` to use 2MB base

## üéØ Benefits of 2MB Chunks

### Memory Efficiency
- **Lower memory usage**: Each chunk operation uses less RAM
- **Better for shared hosting**: Stays within typical memory limits
- **Reduced server load**: Less memory pressure during concurrent uploads

### Filesystem Optimization
- **Fewer inodes used**: Larger chunks = fewer files on disk
- **Reduced filesystem overhead**: Less metadata to manage
- **Better disk I/O patterns**: More efficient read/write operations

### Network Compatibility
- **Cloudflare friendly**: Works well with CDN limits
- **Reduced timeout risk**: Smaller chunks upload faster
- **Better reliability**: Less chance of network interruptions

### Shared Hosting Benefits
- **Resource limits compliance**: Stays within typical hosting constraints
- **Stable performance**: Consistent upload speeds
- **Lower failure rates**: More reliable chunk uploads

## üîß Usage Examples

### View Current Configuration
```bash
php artisan upload:chunk-config
```

### Test Cleanup (Dry Run)
```bash
php artisan upload:cleanup-all --dry-run
```

### Run Full Cleanup
```bash
php artisan upload:cleanup-all --force
```

### Clean Specific Types
```bash
php artisan upload:cleanup-temp --chunks --force
php artisan upload:cleanup-temp --failed --force
php artisan upload:cleanup-temp --orphaned --force
```

## üìã Cron Job Setup

### Single Cron Entry (Recommended)
```bash
* * * * * cd /path/to/your/project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

### Manual Cron Jobs (Alternative)
```bash
# Clean expired files daily at 2 AM
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/your/project && php artisan files:cleanup --force

# Clean temporary files twice daily
0 2,14 * * * cd /path/to/your/project && php artisan upload:cleanup-temp --force

# Comprehensive cleanup weekly
0 3 * * 0 cd /path/to/your/project && php artisan upload:cleanup-all --force
```

## üöÄ Future Hardware Upgrades

When upgrading to better hardware, simply update the environment variable:

```env
# Upgrade from 2MB to 10MB chunks
CHUNK_SIZE=10485760

# Adjust cleanup intervals for better hardware
CHUNKED_UPLOAD_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_HOURS=12
CLEANUP_TEMP_CHUNKS_AGE_HOURS=48
```

The code includes comments to guide these upgrades without requiring extensive changes.
